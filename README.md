# ETCH-A-SKETCH
This activity is part of the activities presented in the Odin project curriculum.

This is the version of the game etch a sketch that I have developed in which css styles such as flexbox among others and the manipulation of the DOM using javascript are applied.

The interface adapts to the responsive part making use of media queries in css. I am going to improve this version in this regard.

Regarding the functionality, it successfully fulfills in its entirety as I expected.

The background used is obtained from the url: https://d3q33rbmdkxzj.cloudfront.net/1588404277337_Diuudf.png and the favicon it is used that is obtained from the url: https://www.iconspng.com/download/49606
